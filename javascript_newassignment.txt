	-------------------------
	|			|
	Savings			Current
	    (isSalary)		     (odLimit)


Now, 
create 1 object of savings with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and isSalary.
create 1 object of currrent with accountNumber, accountHolderName, accountBalance and odLimit.

use savings account object to call a function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below 0.

use current account object to calla function withdraw(amount), that will subtract the amount from the accountBalance, Note that accountBalance should not go below negative of odLimit.
